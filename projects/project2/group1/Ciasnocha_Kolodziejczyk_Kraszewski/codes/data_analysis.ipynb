    "Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the dataset is probably artificial and was generated with a specific pattern. Since maximal reduction of the used feature is goal, for this moment, the best candidates for the feature selection are the features 0-9 and 100-109. It must be noted that there are high correlations between the features in the first group, which means that they can be expressed as a linear combination of each other.\n",

Neural Networks are also a good candidate, but given the size of the dataset, there is a high risk of overfitting. SVM seems as a good candidate, but it does not provide probability of the prediction, which is a necessity in this task (where we want to return the most probable samples)."
